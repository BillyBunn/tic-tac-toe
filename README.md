# Tic Tac Toe

The same react tutorial app built in different ways.

### [Basic](./basic)

Follows tutorial instructions in the [official React docs](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html). App-level state, mix of class and functional components.

### [Redux](./redux)

Uses [`redux`](https://redux.js.org/) and [`react-redux`](https://react-redux.js.org/). The state of the app lives in a single _store_. To change state, components emit an _action_ object which have corresponding _reducers_â€”functions which transform the application state.
